Но новая теология сердца отказывается от доказательства; она не может быть отвергнута, потому что она не претендует на доказательство своей точки зрения. В конечном счете единственным основанием для ее принятия оказывается то, что она позволяет нам предаваться приятным грезам.

        "We conducted a comparative evaluation between Iteration 2 and Iteration 4 on a diverse set of emoji-rich queries. The goal was to identify which approach more effectively captures the emotional and contextual meaning of the emoji inputs and retrieves semantically relevant quotes from the embedding database.\n",
        "\n",
        "Summary of Findings:\n",
        "* Iteration 2 consistently outperformed Iteration 4 across the majority of test cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It produced more emotionally aligned, contextually relevant, and coherent quote selections.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Average cosine similarities were higher for Iteration 2 in almost all cases, and the retrieved quotes better reflected the emotion or theme of the emoji input.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In contrast, Iteration 4 frequently generated off-topic or overly abstract quotes, sometimes missing the tone (e.g., joy, irony, intimacy) intended by the emoji input."
